# Sorting-Visualizer
The sorting visualizer is a powerful tool that allows users to witness the sorting process in action, making it an ideal resource for understanding and studying different sorting algorithms. With this visualizer, users can choose from a selection of popular sorting algorithms such as selection sort, bubble sort, and heap sort.

Selection sort, known for its simplicity, involves dividing the array into two portions: the sorted and unsorted sections. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion and moves it to the beginning of the sorted portion. By visually observing each step of the process, users can gain insight into the selection sort algorithm's functioning and efficiency.

Bubble sort, another commonly taught algorithm, is characterized by its repeated comparison and swapping of adjacent elements. The visualizer showcases the bubble sort's step-by-step execution, providing an immersive experience as the larger elements "bubble" to the top of the array. This sorting method's simplicity and intuitive visualization make it an excellent starting point for learning about sorting algorithms.

Heap sort, a more advanced algorithm, utilizes a binary heap data structure to efficiently sort the array. Users can select this option in the visualizer to witness the step-by-step process of building a heap, extracting the maximum element, and rearranging the remaining elements. This interactive visualization helps users grasp the intricacies of heap sort and appreciate its time complexity advantages.

In summary, the sorting visualizer is a valuable educational tool that allows users to explore and comprehend different sorting algorithms through an engaging and interactive interface. Whether it's the straightforward selection sort, the intuitive bubble sort, or the efficient heap sort, this visualizer provides an immersive experience that aids in understanding the inner workings and trade-offs of each algorithm.
